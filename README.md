## 50's

This project was built for a family exercise competition. The core is built with React, although it just uses iFrames. It's not meant to be pretty, was done very quickly, and was made primarily for mobile devices.

As you can tell by the structure of the app, at the beginning I was going to build it out using separate components but for the sake of time I just threw it together because no one would use/see it outside of my family.
